# Starship Re-entry Website

Goal is a simple page to allow users to visualise a launch and re-enty of Starship.
Uses Leaflet javascript: https://leafletjs.com
Plan is to add in data from https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities to show population centres.
Will need to see how much of that free data set is for around the border between the USA and Mexico.

Use the page:  https://long-haired-git.github.io/
